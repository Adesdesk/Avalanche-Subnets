# Project Title
Avalanche-Subnets

## Description

Project: Defi Empire, A Simple DeFI Kingdom Clone
A practice project that demonstrates how to set up one's very own EVM subnet on Avalanche, an excellent starting point for building a DeFi Kingdom clone. This project covers aspects such as creating and deploying a custom subnet, and then deploying two smart contracts onto it: an ERC20 token contract and a Vault contract. The contracts serve as the foundational building blocks for my DeFi Kingdom clone, allowing me to explore the exciting world of decentralized finance and take steps towards building my very own DeFi empire.
